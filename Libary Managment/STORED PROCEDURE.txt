END //

2-Let see how many copies of the book titled are owned by each libary branch
	Example : 
--2- How many copies of the book titled "The Lost Tribe" are owned by each library branch?

DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCopyBookInBranches()

WHERE books.Book_Title = 'The Lost Tribe';
END // 
DELIMITER ;

CALL GetCopyBookInBranches();


3-Let retrieve the names of all borrowers who dot have any books checked out 

DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE NoLoans() 
BEGIN

WHERE NOT EXISTS (
